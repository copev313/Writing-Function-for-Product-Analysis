    "<p>Have you ever started your data analysis and ended up with repetitive code? Our colleague Brenda who works as a Product Analyst, has found herself in this situation and has asked us for some help. She's written a script to pull Net Promotor Score (NPS) data from various sources. NPS works by asking <em>How likely is it that you would recommend our product to a friend or colleague?</em> with a rating scale of 0 to 10. Brenda has set up this NPS survey in various ways, including emails and pop-ups on the mobile app and website. To compile the data from the different sources, she's written the following code:</p>\r\n",

    "## 7. Breaking down NPS by source\n",
    "<p>Is it good to have an NPS score around 10? The worst NPS score you can get is -100 when all respondents are detractors, and the best is 100 when all respondents are promoters. Depending on the industry of your service or product, average NPS scores vary a lot. However, a negative score is a bad sign because it means you have more unhappy customers than happy customers. Typically, a score over 50 is considered excellent, and above 75 is considered best in class.</p>\n",
    "<p>Although our score is above 0, it's still on the lower end of the spectrum. The product team concludes that majorly increasing NPS across our customer base is a priority. Luckily, we have this NPS data that we can analyze more so we can find data-driven solutions. A good start would be breaking down the NPS score by the source type. For instance, if people are rating lower on the web than mobile, that's some evidence we need to improve the browser experience.</p>"
